## Contribution Workflow:

- Create a fork of this repo.
- Clone your fork of your repo on your pc.
- [Add Upstream to your clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
- **Every change** that you do, it has to be on a branch. After committing, you need to open a pull request.
- Make sure that before you create a new branch for new changes, [you have synced with upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork).
